Here are a collection of projects I work on.

### FRC Team 973: The Greybots

I am a programmer for Atascadero High School's premier robotics team, [Team 973 The Greybots](https://greybots.com). Here are some of the projects I work on for the team...

#### Greybots Signin

[Greybots Signin](https://github.com/Team973/greybots-signin) is a custom-built clock in/clock out system for tracking student attendance at robotics meets. It is a webapp that uses [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) to store student data.

#### GreyDash

GreyDash is a custom-built dashboard for debugging, camera viewing, streaming data to and from the robot, and much more. It features [Smoothie Charts](http://smoothiecharts.org), a JavaScript graphing utility which makes it extremely useful for tuning [closed-loop PID systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) that we use for automated movements.

#### 2018 Robot Code

Our [2018 Robot: Havoc](https://github.com/Team973/2018-inseason) was a quarterfinalist at the Houston World Championship. I programmed the [Drive Subsystem](https://github.com/Team973/2018-inseason/blob/dev/src/subsystems/Drive.h) code that controls the drivetrain of the robot.

#### 2019 Robot Code

Our [2019 Robot: Fireball](https://github.com/Team973/2019-inseason) was the Houston World Chamiponship Winner, as well as a two time winner of the Autonomous Programming Award. I programmed and tuned many parts of the robot, but mostly taught new programming students C++.

### Miscellaneous DIY Projects

Here are a few of my DIY projects I have worked on...

#### ChickenPotPi

[ChickenPotPi](https://github.com/Chris2fourlaw/ChickenPotPi) is a Python GPIO application that runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) for opening and closing a motorized chicken coop door on a certain schedule. It is controlled using a web interface hosted on the RPi and is accessible on the internet.
